# RUVIS
RUVIS animates a Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectory in a web-page using the babylonJS API. Trajectories can be viewed a cross platforms, since it only requires a WebGL compatible browser (including Windows PC's, Mac OS, Linux, tablets and phones). For now this tool is only optimized for RUMD and Matlab simulations, but that will change in the future.

Please note that RUVIS is in an early development stage. Feel free to contact me (Ulf R. Pedersen) for questions or suggestions on ruvis@urp.dk.
