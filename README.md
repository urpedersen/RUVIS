# RUVIS
RUVIS animates a Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectory in a web-page using the babylonJS API. Trajectories can be viewed a cross platforms, since it only requires a WebGL compatible browser (including Windows PC's, Mac OS, Linux, tablets and phones). Tools are provided for RUMD and Matlab simulations.

Please note that RUVIS is in an early development stage. Feel free to contact me ([Ulf R. Pedersen](http://urp.dk)) for questions or suggestions on ruvis@urp.dk. The project is currently hosted at GitHub Inc., however, the permanet location of the project is http://urp.dk/ruvis/.
